# Tic-Tac-Toe-Ai
This program was for an assignment for my Artificial Intelligence course, where I had to implement a tic tac toe game with one player being the user and the other player being AI. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the AI to move on its own and had to manually enter its moves when running it.
